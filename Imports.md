# Summary

We propose adding an importing mechanism to the WGSL shading language as an extension.

# Motivation

When writing bigger WGSL shaders, one tends to **split the code into reusable pieces**. Examples are re-using a set of lighting calculation functions and sharing a struct between two compute shaders and.

However, current WGSL tooling is not built for this. The official language purposefully does not include this feature, nor does it provide adjacent features like namespaces, and there is no standardized extension yet.

We also should account for **importing shader from libraries**. Ideally, users could upload WGSL shaders to existing package managers, which other users could then consume.

Finally, we want **multiple tools** which can compile WGSL-with-imports down to raw WGSL. Using WGSL-with-imports both in Rust projects and in web projects should be possible.

## Guide-level explanation

The `import` statement extension brings items or entire modules into scope. Import statements map to files with minimal searching.

```wgsl
// Importing a single function using a relative path
import super::lighting::pbr;

// Importing multiple items
import my::geom::sphere::{ draw, default_radius as foobar };

// Imports a whole module. Use it with `bevy_ui::name`
import bevy_ui;
```

These can then be used anywhere in the source code.

```wgsl
fn main() {
    bevy_ui::quad(vec2f(0.0, 1.0), 1.0);
    let a = draw(3);
}
```

Both `bevy_ui` and `my` are packages in the current project. Language servers and related tools can look in a `wesl.toml` file to find the location of the packages. This lets libraries be published to package managers, and users can import them with a simple syntax.

Recursive import definitions are also supported, which leads to shorter import statements.

```wgsl
import bevy_pbr::{
  forward_io::VertexOutput,
  pbr_types::{PbrInput, pbr_input_new},
  pbr_bindings
};
```

To find the relevant items, the following algorithm is used:

Proceding left to right through the path segments, consider the segments `prev` and `seg`.
1. if `prev.wesl` exists and includes WESL elements, check if `seg` is one of those elements, e.g. `fn seg` or `namespace seg`.
1. else if the directory `prev/` exists, check to see if the file `seg.wesl` or the directory `seg/` is in the `prev/` directory;
1. error if a `seg` is not found. 

# Reference-level explanation

A WESL program is composed of a tree of WESL modules.

Imports must appear as the first items in a WESL file. They can import entire modules or individual  "importable items" (see [GLOSSARY.md](./GLOSSARY.md)).

An import statement is parsed with the following  grammar, with spaces and comments allowed between tokens:
```ebnf
translation_unit:
| import_statement* global_directive* global_decl* 

import_statement:  
| 'import' import_relative? (import_collection | import_path_or_item) ';'  

import_relative:
| 'package' '::' | 'super' '::' ('super' '::')*

import_path_or_item:
| ident '::' (import_collection | import_path_or_item) 
| ident ('as' ident)?

import_collection:
| '{' (import_path_or_item) (',' (import_path_or_item))* ','? '}'
```

Where `translation_unit` and `ident` are defined in the WGSL grammar. 
`ident`s are subject to the usual restrictions, meaning they cannot be keywords or reserved words.


An item import imports a single item. The item can be renamed with the `as` keyword.

An import collection imports multiple items, and allows for nested imports.

To resolve the import, the recursive structure is flattened out. This means turning every `import_collection` into multiple separate imports, ending with the items. 
For instance, `import a::{b, c::{d, e as f}};` would be turned into 
```
import a::b;
import a::c::d;
import a::c::e as f;
```


Then, one iterates over each segment from left to right, and looks it up one by one.

1. We start with the first segment.
    - `super` refers to the parent module. Can be repeated to go up multiple parent modules. Exiting the root is an error.
    - `package` refers to the top level module of the current package.
    - `ident` refers to an identifier that is in scope. If there is none. it falls back to a package.
        - Packages are usually found in the `wgsl.toml` file. It refers to the top level module of that package.
2. We take that as the "current module".
3. We repeatedly look at the next segment.
    1. Item in current module: Take that item. We must be at the last segment, otherwise it's an error.
    2. (Else if re-exported or inline module in current module: We continue with that module.)
    3. Else go to `current module path/ident.wesl`
       - File found: We take that file as the current module.
       - File not found: We assume an empty module as the current module, and continue with that.
       - (Re-exporting changes the path.)
       - (Inline modules do not have a path.)

To get an absolute path to a module, one follows the algorithm above. In step 1, one takes the known absolute path of the `super` module, or the package.
The absolute path of the `super` module is always known, since the first loaded WESL file must always be the root module, and children are only discovered from there.

Once the import has been resolved, the last segment, or its alias, is brought into scope.

The order of the scopes is "user declarations and imported items > package names > predeclared items".
This lets WGSL add more predeclared items without breaking existing WESL code. Package names can shadow predeclared items, and authors are encouraged to avoid doing that.

For example

```wgsl
import bevy_pbr::forward_io::VertexOutput;
```
This first looks for `bevy_pbr.wesl`.
`bevy_pbr.wesl` is found, and doesn't contain an item named `forward_io`.
Thus, we go to `bevy_pbr/forward_io.wesl`. It contains a struct named `VertexOutput`.


Another example

```wgsl
import super::shadowmapping;
```
Assume that the current module lives at `shaders/lighting.wesl`. We first go to the super module at `shaders.wesl`. We then look for an item called `shadowmapping` in `shaders.wesl`.
After not finding it, we look for a module `shadowmapping` at `shaders/shadowmapping.wesl`.

## Filesystem Resolution

To resolve a module on a filesystem, one follows the algorithm above. 
The root folder, or the root module, needs to be provided to the linker. This is currently a linker-specific API, and may change once we introduce a `wesl.toml`.

Linkers should fall back to `.wgsl` files when a `.wesl` file cannot be found.

Due to filesystem limitations, it can happen that WESL idents are invalid file or folder names.
Notable examples are `CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1 - COM9, LPT1 - LPT9` on Windows, and Windows being case-insensitive
We do not take these restrictions into account, instead we just recommend that WESL programmers avoid these special names.


## Inline Usage

The syntax can also be used inline. To do so, we extend 
the [WGSL grammar](https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/#grammar-recursive-descent) as follows.

We introduce 

```ebnf
full_ident:
| import_relative? ident ('::' ident)*
```

and then replace `ident` with `full_ident` in the following places:

```ebnf
core_lhs_expression:
| full_ident
| ...

for_init: 
| full_ident func_call_statement.post.ident
| ...

for_update:
| full_ident func_call_statement.post.ident
| ...

global_decl: 
| 'alias' ident '=' full_ident ...
| ...

primary_expression: 
| full_ident template_elaborated_ident.post.ident
| full_ident template_elaborated_ident.post.ident argument_expression_list
| ...

statement: 
| ...
| full_ident template_elaborated_ident.post.ident argument_expression_list ';'
| ...

type_specifier:
| full_ident ...
```

Examples
```wesl
import foo::bar;

fn main() {
    let a = bar::baz; // Uses bar from the import above
    let b = bevy::main(); // Uses the known bevy package
}
```

## Cyclic Imports

Cyclic imports are allowed.

However, the following is still illegal. 
```
// foo.wesl
import bar::b;
const a = b + 1;
```
```
// bar.wesl
import foo::a;
const b = a + 1;
```
(a depends on b which depends on a)

Basic linker implementations do not need to check for this. Generating broken code and letting the underlying shader compiler throw an error is fine.

## Directives

TODO: https://github.com/wgsl-tooling-wg/wesl-spec/issues/71

## Entry points and pipeline overridable constants

These items are preserved when importing a module. Their name must be preserved. 
They will land in the final module, if they are statically accessed.

- [Entry points](https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/#entry-points)
- [Pipeline overridable constants](https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/#override-decls)

TODO: This will probably be improved after M1.

TODO: https://github.com/wgsl-tooling-wg/wesl-spec/issues/65


## `const_assert`

Generally, WGSL elements are included if they are recursively used from the root module ([statically accessed](https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/#statically-accessed)). 
An import statement by itself doesn't have any side effects. It does not bring in `const_assert`s.
    
`const_assert` statements are also included if they are in the same module or namespace as a used element.
This only refers to the exact module that an element is in, and not any of the parent modules.
`let a = bevy_pbr::lighting::shadows::SHADOW_DEPTH;` would bring in the `const_assert`s of the `shadows` module.

```wgsl
​​​​// main.wesl:
​​​​import foo::bar;
​​​​fn main() { bar(); }

​​​​// foo.wesl:
​​​​import zig::zag;
​​​​const_assert(1 > 0); // included in link because bar is used
​​​​fn bar() { }
​​​​fn miz() { zag() }

​​​​// zig.wesl:
​​​​const_assert(2 < 0); // not included in link
​​​​fn zag() { }
```

`const_assert`s inside functions are treated specially! They can get eliminated during dead-code elimination, which is an observable side-effect.
[WESL deviates from WGSL here](https://github.com/wgsl-tooling-wg/wesl-spec/issues/93).


## Name Mangling

## Dead Code Elimination

Linkers may choose to do dead code elimination, but it is a not-observable implementation detail. 

`const_assert` statements inside of functions will need special treatment.

# Drawbacks

Are there reasons as to why we should we not do this?

- This introduces yet another importing syntax that developers have to learn, instead of using a standard syntax.
- To implement the name mangling, one has to parse WGSL code! This is not trivial, and requires a partial WGSL parser.
- Paths in import statements must consist of valid WGSL identifiers, which can be limiting. This limitation could be lifted by allowing arbitrary strings in import paths, but would make the implementation more complex.

# Rationale and alternatives

## Not agreeing on a standard

One major upside of standardizing it is that it becomes practical for language servers to support it.

The usual alternative is that one library, like shaderc, becomes very popular and the standard ends up being "whatever popular library XYZ does".

An open process lets us find a better solution.

## Preprocessor `#include <lighting.wgsl>`

One alternative, which is common in the GLSL and C worlds, is an including mechanism which simply copy-pastes existing code. A major upside is that this is very simple to implement.

One drawback is that importing the same shader multiple times, which can also happen indirectly, does not work without other preprocessor features.

```c
// A.wgsl
#include <lighting.wgsl>
#include <math.wgsl>
```

```c
// lighting.wgsl
#include <math.wgsl>
```

would not work, since anything defined in `math.wgsl` would be imported twice. In C-land, this is solved by using _include guards_.

Another drawback is that using the same name twice is impossible. In C-land, this leads to pseudo-namespaces, where major libraries will prefix all of their functions with a few symbols. An example of this is the Vulkan API `vkBeginCommandBuffer` or `vkCmdDraw`.

A future drawback is that "privacy" or "visibility" becomes very difficult to implement. Everything that is imported is automatically public and easily accessible.
In C-land, the workaround is using header files. In other languages, such as Python, the convention ends up being "anything prefixed with an underscore `_` is private".

## TypeScript-like imports

The Bevy team, with a large shader codebase, had a few wishes

- A short syntax
- Inline usage

## Rust-like imports

To fully copy Rust's importing syntax, one needs something akin to a `mod` statement.
The rules have carefully been architected to imitate the Rust style, while not requiring an explicit `mod` statement. 

In Rust, `use foo::bar;` could either map to "import an item called `bar` from `foo.rs`" or it could map to "import the module `foo/bar.rs`". Rust uses the explicit `mod` statement to disambiguate. We instead check for the presence of an item.

## Putting exports in comments

This would have the advantage of letting some existing WGSL tools ignore the new syntax. For example, a WGSL formatter would not need to know about imports, and could just format the code as usual.

## Using an alternative shader language

There are multiple higher level shading languages, such as [slang](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang) or [Rust-GPU](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-gpu) which support imports. They also support more features that WGSL currently does not offer. For complex projects, this can very much pay off.

The downside is using additional tooling, and dealing with an additional translation layer.
An additonal translation layer could lock shader authors out of certain WGSL features.

Also, higher level GPU languages are typically processed at build time,
which precludes using language features to adapt to runtime conditions
like GPU characteristics or user settings.

## Composing shader code as strings at runtime

One alternative is to compose shader code at runtime
by simply joining together strings with WGSL code, perhaps
with some string templating for flexibility.
This has the major downside of not being statically analyzable.
The IDE cannot provide autocompletion,
and a language server cannot check for errors.

A linker that understands imports also typically
composes shader strings, and can link at runtime.
But a linker uses its more sophisticated understanding of WGSL
to drive composition.
For example, a linker can identify imports
that are needed by other imports,
automating shader composition for users.

# Implementation

This will be implemented in the [JavaScript](https://github.com/wgsl-tooling-wg/wesl-js) and [Rust](https://github.com/wgsl-tooling-wg/wesl-rs) linkers.

# Test cases

Test cases will be available on
[github](https://github.com/wgsl-tooling-wg/wesl-testsuite).

# Future possibilities

## Namespaces

We hope that namespaces will be added to WGSL itself. Then, the importing mechanism can be extended to fully support namespaces, for example by treating each file as introducing its own namespace.

## Source maps

We encourage tooling authors to also implement source maps when implementing imports. This aids
- Error Reporting. When Naga or Tint report an error in the generated WGSL code, we want to map the error location back to the WESL code.
- Debugging. Eventually we hope to have a full toolchain of WESL to WGSL to SPIR-V, with source maps at each step. In the end, it should be possible for RenderDoc to show the original WESL code.

## Scoped imports

Allow imports that are only active within one function?
